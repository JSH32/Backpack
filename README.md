## Backpack
Backpack is an open source file uploading and sharing tool that can be deployed easily to any docker environment. It aims to be extendable, easy to use, and support many storage providers and databases.

### Providers
We aim to support many storage providers for backpack. This will allow you to have a choice in the storage medium you desire for storing your files. Currently supported file providers are listed below.

 - Local storage
 - S3 Protocol

### Development
This project is in heavy development. It is not safe to use yet and is missing crucial features. Contributions are accepted and encouraged. There is no support in getting the project up and running right now because it is not ready.

### Roadmap
I know we aren't even at the version one launch yet, but I have some features in mind for version two release. I'm going to list them below, so we have a log. So far, the goal of version one is basic pomf functionality.
 - [ ] Multiple language support
 - [ ] Paste support (hastebin, pastebin)
 - [ ] Plugin API (Basic scripting to add functionality/callbacks)
 - [x] Multiple database support (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
 - [x] NextJS client and color themes.
